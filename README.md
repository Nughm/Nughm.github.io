Little Man Computer simulator that uses the basic LMC instruction set (LDA, STA, ADD, SUB, BRA, etc...) with registers displayed.

HOW TO RUN CODE:
  - Type in code (or load my example code!)
  - Press Submit on the bottom left
  - If no error is given press run code

FEATURES:
  - Change the speed of the dots with the "<<" and ">>"
  - The "PAUSE" button allows for the simulation to be paused (hence the name!)
  - If the simulation is still running but the user wants it to be stopped so that the LMC code can be edited, the "PAUSE" then "RESET" button can be pressed
  ~~- The "HYPER" button removes the animation from the simulation and makes it so the program works like a typical LMC simulator~~
  ~~- The "WAIT" button allows for the program to be paused automatically after each step (Fetch step, Execute step), pressing pause will not disable the auto-pause, but will resume the simulation until the next step.~~
  - Tutorial of the VN Architecture is also in the program, and can be accessed by pressing the Von Neumann Explanation button
